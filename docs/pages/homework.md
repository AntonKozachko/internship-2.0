# Homework
Hi, welcome to the Homeworks section!

Your homeworks will be based on extension and enhancement of your test task. So please, make sure it is deployed to Github Pages in order to make it possible for our mentors to check it after every lecture.

Good luck and enjoy your practice time!
## Homework 1
Ok, so for your test task you had several users in our system. Let's upgrade them to the next level this time. Now you would need to create two Classes User (base class) and Admin (should be inherited from User). 

### Requirements:
 - Each team member should belong either to User class or Admin class.
 - When user opens an application he/she has to authorize himself using the select modal (like in the example mockup).
 - If authorized user is Admin he is able to create and update events(if Drag and Drop was implemented in your test task).
 - If authorized user is User he/she is not able to create/update events. This means that 'Create Event' button should be hidden for those users.

### Additional requirements:
- Please make sure your application meets the ES6 standard and uses all ES6 features where it is appropriate and possible.
